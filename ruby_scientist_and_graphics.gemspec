  spec.description   = <<~DESC
    Ruby Scientist and Graphics is a practical data science toolkit for Ruby.
    It includes a lightweight built-in DataFrame for loading, cleaning, and transforming data; quick
    descriptive statistics and correlations; charting via Gruff (bar and line); and simple ML utilities
    (linear regression and k-means)â€”all behind a small, unified, pandas-inspired API.

    Key features:
    - Load data from CSV and JSON.
    - Clean and transform (remove/add columns, handle missing values, limit rows).
    - Describe datasets and compute correlations quickly.
    - Create bar and line charts with customization options.
    - Train/predict with linear regression; cluster with k-means.
    - Save/load project state (data + trained model) and run simple pipelines.
    - Optional backend adapters (e.g., Rover) while keeping the same API.

    Ideal for analysts and developers who want to explore data in Ruby without relying on Python or R.
    Note: plotting via Gruff uses rmagick, which requires ImageMagick installed on the system.
